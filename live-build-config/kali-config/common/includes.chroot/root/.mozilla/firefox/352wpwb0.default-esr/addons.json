We can help. At DuckDuckGo, we believe online privacy should be simple.\n\nDuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials comes packed with best-in-class privacy essentials and makes browsing in Firefox even faster.\n\n    Escape Online Tracking — automatically block hidden third-party trackers we can find lurking on websites you visit, which stops the companies behind those trackers from collecting and selling your data.\n    Search Privately — our private search engine comes built-in so you can search the Internet without being tracked.\n    Enforce Encryption — force sites to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes, like from unwanted snoopers and Internet service providers.\n    Decode Privacy — each site you visit gets a Privacy Grade (A-F) so you can see how protected you are at a glance, and you can even dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with GPC — built into the browser, Global Privacy Control (GPC) intends to help you express your legal opt-out rights automatically. This will tell websites not to sell or share your personal information under future legal frameworks (e.g., CCPA, GDPR) in various states or countries.\n\n\n\nPrivacy, simplified.\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/\nDevice Privacy: https://spreadprivacy.com/tag/device-privacy-tips/\nPrivacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/\nOpen Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension","weeklyDownloads":11550,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"DuckDuckGo","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/3946396/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/243/243108.png?modified=1622132160","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/243/243108.jpg?modified=1622132160","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"DuckDuckGo — Privacy, simplified.
